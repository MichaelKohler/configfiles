# LSCOLORS The value of this variable describes what color to use for which attribute when colors
# are enabled with CLICOLOR. This string is a concatenation of pairs of the format fb, where f is
# the foreground color and b is the background color.
#
# The color designators are as follows:
#
# a black
# b red
# c green

# H bold light grey; looks like bright white
# x default foreground or background
#
# Note that the above are standard ANSI colors. The actual display may differ depending on the color
# capabilities of the terminal in use.
#
# The order of the attributes are as follows:
#
# 1. directory
# 2. symbolic link
# 3. socket
# 4. pipe
# 5. executable
# 6. block special
# 7. character special
# 8. executable with setuid bit set
# 9. executable with setgid bit set
# 10. directory writable to others, with sticky bit
# 11. directory writable to others, without sticky bit
